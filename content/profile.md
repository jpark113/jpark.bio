Welcome! I’m an early-career researcher and practitioner focused on **digital diplomacy**, **Asia–Pacific international relations**, and **multilateral cooperation**, with a regional focus on **Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia**.

Currently, I’m a **Program Officer at Human Asia** (Seoul), where I lead bilingual web, program, and partnership initiatives. Previously, I worked in **general affairs** at **Samsung Electronics (HA)** in South Carolina, supporting international assignee relocation and executive protocol.

I’m completing an **M.A. in International Development and Cooperation** at **Korea University** (expected Aug 2025) and hold a **B.A. from Waseda University** (Tokyo).

**Recent:** research on linking early nutrition to skills development in Lao PDR; designed a Human Rights Summer School program-to-internship pipeline.
